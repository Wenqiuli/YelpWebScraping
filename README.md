# Data Scraping for Popular Restarants

1. **Input File format:**
    ```
  Minneapolis|Downtown
  Minneapolis|University
  St Paul|Cathedral Hill
    ```


2. **restaurant.py**

  This python program is a data scrapper that will fetch 40 records for each neighborhood in city mentioned in Input file. Here, we `import getLocation` to get longitude and latitude for each neighborhood through Google Geocoding API. The logic for getting location coordinates is written in `getLocation.py`. The output file generated by the program will be in `output/SEARCHTERM.csv`. With context of this project, the *SEARCHTERM* is **restaurants**. The file usage is as show below: 
  
    ```      
        $ python restaurant.py [-h] -f FILENAME -s SEARCHTERM
	      Scrape Data through Yelp API
	      optional arguments:
	      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	      -f FILENAME, --fileName FILENAME
	                             Name of file containing neighbourhoods and their respective cities in pipe-delimited fashion
	      -s SEARCHTERM, --searchTerm SEARCHTERM
	                             Search Category for the data. eg. restaurants, bars, etc.
    ```

3. **scrapeDate.py**
  
  This python program will fetch first review date for the restaurants from Yelp website. The program takes input a file with restaurant IDs for which you need the first review date. If there are no reviews or reviews aren't in English language, the program would insert `99999` as dummy value. The output file generates would be `output/firstReviewDate.csv` The file usage is as shown below:

    ```
      $ python scrapeDate.py [-h] -f FILENAME
  
      optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f FILENAME, --fileName FILENAME
                            input file with restaurantIDs
    ```

# Data Scraping for Reviews 

1. **scrapeReviews.py**

  This python program will take location, category (eg. chinese, indian, mexican, etc.) and term (eg restaurants, bars, etc.) as input, and will fetch the user reviews which will suggest improvements for the restaurants. The filtered reviews will be output in `reviewData` file. The program usage is as shown below:
  
  ```
  $ python scrapeReviews.py [-h] -l LOCATION -c CATEGORY -t TERM

	Scrape Reviews through Yelp API and Web
	optional arguments:
  	-h, --help            show this help message and exit
  	-l LOCATION, --location LOCATION
        	                Location where you want to search reviews
  	-c CATEGORY, --category CATEGORY
                        	Category for the reviews. eg. chinese, indian, etc.
  	-t TERM, --term TERM  Search by restaurant, bar, etc
```

## Datasets Created:

1. RestaurantData.xlsx 	- The raw dataset generated after running `restaurant.py`
2. filteredRestaurantData1.xlsx - filtered dataset after removing duplicates and noise data (no location, zipcode,etc)
3. filteredRestaurantData2.xlsx - filtered dataset after removing cities restaurants with restaurants less than 100
4. filteredRestaurantData3.xlsx - final dataset for restaurants with review_count > 100 and rating > 4.5
5. reviewData.xlsx - filtered reviews giving improvements for restaurants. This dataset is generated after text mining code `scrapeReviews.py`

## Visualization Files and Codes:
1. plotting distribution of rating and review count.R
2. Tableau_Worbook.rar 
3. Yelp.R - impute missing vales using mice package
4. Additionally each workbook in dataset above has a sheet called pivots which has analysis along with figures for that workbook.
